# Using Deep Learning Algorithms for Defect Detection

A great deal of research has been performed on applying deep learning to object detection tasks. The resulting methods have proved to be quicker and more accurate than traditional computer vision techniques, however adoption of these algorithms for laboratory usage has lagged due to the difficulty in acquiring the large, labeled datasets necessary for training neural networks. We will be attempting to determine the efficacy of generating labeled training data from a simulation, and using it to detect defects in real-world data.
