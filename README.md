Setup:
clone the repo
Create a new GPU-enabled tensorflow environment with "conda create --name ENVIRONMENT_NAME tensorflow-gpu"
activate the new environment
Use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
cd darkflow
run "setup.py build_ext --inplace"




Tools for labeling:
BBox-Label-Tool allows you to draw bounding boxes on images
Place the images inside the BBox-Label-Tool folder inside Images\001 (or other folder)
Inside the main BBox-Label-Tool folder, run python main.py. Enter the folder number in the top and click load. Must use python 2
Draw boxes around the objects you want detected. Annotations will be output into AnnotationsXML
For converting files containing bounding box coordinates into properly formatted xml annotations, use the tools inside ImageAnnotation

Using darkflow:
To facilitate training and running the model, several scripts have been included in the darkflow folder.
Inside trainFlow.py, edit the path options to point to training images and their annotations. As long as the
model is being trained for one class, running trainFlow.py will train a model for the annotated data. The loss should be less than one when
training is complete.

runFlow.py allows you to run the trained model on new data. Edit the path variables in the file to point to the data you want labeled.
The script will output the images with bounding boxes drawn and .json files with the detection data. This will use the last trained model

runFlowPB.py allows you to load a model from a .pb and .meta file, which are saved when a model is finished training.

validate.py allows you to check annotations generated by runFlow.py against ground truth annotations. Simply modify the path variables to point
to the generated annotations and the ground truth annotations.


Other tools:
Inside the matlab folder are scripts for generating training data containing circles. circlemaker.m generates a very noisy image with circles and circlemakerCLEAN.m generates
images with greatly reduced noise. 
The houghAnnotate scripts generate annotations using the circular hough transform. These are mainly for evaluating the effectiveness of the ML model
when compared to conventional techniques.
